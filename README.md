# Photo Downloader
 This is a website that I created in order to have family/friends upload photos for me to create a data base of pictures.
 The idea behind this has to do with some machine learning stuff.
 I thought it would be cool to have a machine learning model be able to learn how to convert black and white images back into color.
 To do this I figured I would need a large database of pictures, which is where this website came in.
 I designed this to be able to run on my raspberry pi and save all the uploaded images to a flash drive that is plugged into the pi.
 If the website is running, you can check it out [here](http://chris-blueberrypi.ddns.net:725/)
